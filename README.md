# Drowsiness-Detection
The Drowsiness Detection System is an AI-based application designed to monitor a person's alertness level in real time, 
particularly focusing on drivers to prevent accidents caused by fatigue.
Using computer vision techniques, the system detects the user's facial landmarks to track eye movements and yawning patterns. 
If signs of drowsiness are detected (such as prolonged eye closure or frequent yawning), an alert is triggered to wake up the driver.
